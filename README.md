# USING LLM FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION ON UNSTRUCTURED DATA THROUGH SLACK

## 1. Project Overview
This is a simple project to use an LLM to parse unstructured data, in this case, email messages to extract key information from them. The LLM is pre-prompted and served to the SDR's through a Slack App to perform the feature extraction.

## 2. Use Case
The client is a broker for retail cleaning jobs and they use an internally developed platform to manage their leads and sales. As they begin to scale their business, their SDR's time is increasingly being taken up to process and extract specific key information in new job bid emails that need to be entered into the internal platform. As email messages are unstructured data and come in different formats from different vendors, implementing a traditional rule-based approach to extract the desired information would require the rules to be constantly adjusted manually to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy. Instead, the capabilities of a generative LLM to perform the extraction was used due to its ability to process unstructured data unsupervised and achieve excellent accuracy.
